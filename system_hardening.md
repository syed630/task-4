System Hardening: Defense Implementation

Apply Security Patches (Conceptual) The vsftpd exploit succeeded because the software was extremely outdated. Action to Document: You would first perform a system update to refresh the package lists and then a full system upgrade. sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade Action for vsftpd: Specifically, you would remove or upgrade the vulnerable service.

To remove the vsftpd service (the ultimate fix for that specific exploit)
sudo apt remove vsftpd

Disable Unused Services Reducing the attack surface is a critical security measure. The Nmap scan revealed many unnecessary services running (like Telnet, NFS, rlogin). Action to Document: You would stop and disable services that are not strictly necessary for the system's function.

Example: Disabling the insecure Telnet service
sudo update-rc.d telnetd disable sudo /etc/init.d/openbsd-inetd restart

Configure Firewall to Block Malicious Traffic This is the most crucial hands-on step for defense. You will configure the iptables firewall to prevent future unauthorized network access. A. Set Deny-by-Default Policy (Most Secure) Flush Existing Rules: Clear any existing firewall rules. sudo iptables -F sudo iptables -X Set Default Policy to DROP: Set the default rule to drop all incoming packets that aren't explicitly allowed. sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP

Allow Essential, Secured Services Now, explicitly allow the few services the system must run (e.g., SSH and HTTP). Allow Established Connections: Allow returning traffic for legitimate connections that have already been opened.

sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

Allow SSH (Port 22): sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

Allow HTTP (Port 80): sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
