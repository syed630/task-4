Reconnaissance (Information Gathering) This phase is about gathering initial information without actively probing the system, though in practice (as in your Task 2), it transitions quickly to active measures.

Activity Focus Documentation Target Identification Confirming the scope of the assessment. State the target: Metasploitable2 VM with IP address 192.168.56.4 System Check Determining if the target is live. Document using the ping command to confirm the host is reachable on the Host-Only network. Passive Info Gathering general OS knowledge. Note that the system is running a Linux operating system (confirmed later by OS fingerprinting).

Scanning (Discovering the Attack Surface) This phase actively maps the network and host to discover vulnerabilities.

Activity Focus Tools Used Documentation Port & Service Scan Finding open ports and software versions. Nmap (-sS -sV -O flags) Document the Nmap output (from Task 2): List the open ports (21, 22, 23, 80, etc.), services, and the crucial vulnerable version: vsftpd 2.3.4. Vulnerability Scan Automated search for known weaknesses. Nessus Essentials (or OpenVAS) Document the finding of the vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoor vulnerability, noting its Critical severity. OS Fingerprinting Determining the Operating System. Nmap (-O flag) Confirm the OS is Linux 2.6.x, which is necessary for selecting the correct exploits.

Exploitation (Gaining Access) This phase involves leveraging a discovered vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Activity Focus Tools Used Documentation Vulnerability Selection Choosing the most reliable exploit. Research (Based on Nmap) Select the vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoor. Exploit Configuration Setting up the payload and target. Metasploit Framework Document the exact steps: use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor, set RHOSTS 192.168.56.4, and set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/interact. Execution and Shell Running the exploit and connecting. Netcat (nc) Document the successful connection (nc -nv [IP] 6200). Include a screenshot showing the successful execution sequence.

Post-Exploitation (Proving Impact and Maintaining Access) This phase is about demonstrating the severity of the compromise and gathering intelligence.

Activity Focus Commands Used Documentation Proof of Root Access Establishing the highest privilege. whoami Critical: Must show the command returning root. System Enumeration Mapping the compromised system. uname -a (Kernel) and netstat -tuln (Internal ports). Document the system details gathered from these commands. Credential Harvesting Stealing sensitive user data. cat /etc/shadow Crucial: Document the extraction of password hashes (needed for the John the Ripper task). Include a screenshot showing the shadow file content. Password Cracking Proving the hashes are usable. John the Ripper Document the tool usage and the successful cracking of the weak msfadmin password.
